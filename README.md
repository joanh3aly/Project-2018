Summary of Fisher's Iris Data Set 

Fisher's Iris flower data set is a data set comprised of the length and width of the sepals and petals of 50 samples each of Iris setosa, Iris verginica and Iris versicolor, measured in centimeters. 

In 1936 Ronald Fisher, a British biologist and statistician used the data set to create a linear discriminant model to distinguish the Iris species from each other. His research is recorded in his paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems.

Initial Investigations 

The pandas library was used to import the dataset into my Python script. 
Numpy was used to calculate the mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values of the different columns (representing length and width of sepals and petals)
Mathplotlib was used to create scatterplots and bar charts comparing the different features: compare sepals and petals.

Standard deviations of the 4 features in the data set:
